The following questions are answered in the notebook

* Is the relationship significant?

* Are any model assumptions violated?

* Is there any multicollinearity in the model?

* In the multivariate models are predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?

* In in multivariate models rank the most significant predictor variables and exclude insignificant ones from the model.

* Does the model make sense?

* Does regularization help?

* Which independent variables are significant?

* Which hyperparameters are important?
